Wind energy is a strong candidate for displacing coal and other fossil fuels in electricity generation. Wind turbines are actively being deployed for power generation today. Short of getting involved in that industry, there's not much I can do directly to accelerate turbine deployment — other than looking for opportunities to buy carbon offsets that contribute to wind projects.

Indirectly, I can help counter FUD[^1] about wind (and other renewables) by internalizing the counterarguments to common objections:

- **Can wind provide base load, given variability in the weather?**
  - When the air is still in one region, there are strong winds somewhere else. The aggregate wind power across large geographic regions will be adequate to satisfy substantial portions of base load.
  - The design of the existing electrical grid and structure of utility companies assumes centralized generation, but that is not a hard physical constraint. Availability of renewable energy sources will drive improvements to the grid for a more decentralized model that supports selling excess energy over larger distances.

* **Isn't wind only cost-competitive with fossil fuels due to subsidies?**
  - Fossil fuels are also subsidized. Pollution from coal plants have public health consequences that are paid for by both the state and private individuals — that's a subsidy.
  - Coal and nuclear plants ultimately drive turbines by boilding
