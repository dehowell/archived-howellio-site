David Howell is a software developer, but isn't comfortable being pigeon-holed as just a STEM-type. He did some graduate work in physics and worked on a variety of particle physics experiments, but ultimately found writing software a more congenial career path for a curious generalist—software is all about formalizing other problem domains. Besides, software engineering has its own panoply of theoretical paradigms, weird rituals, and obtuse systems to learn.

## Notable Projects

* ['in.c'](http://pixel-to-noise.github.io/in.c/) is a browser-based, partially automated chamber ensemble that performs Terry Riley's "In C", made in collaboration with [Jeffrey Pierce](https://jeffreypierce.net).
*   [dehowell/ontology](https://github.com/dehowell/ontology/tree/master/src/main/java/io/howell/ontology) is a library of demented Java types.
* While working at Wolfram Research, I wrote the (later open-sourced) [HadoopLink](https://github.com/dehowell/HadoopLink), a Mathematica library for working with a Hadoop cluster.
* I published my reading notes from learning the `d3.js` data visualization library as [The D3.js Annotated Bibliography](https://www.howell.io/tag/d3-bibliography/).
* My [Codex Vitae](https://github.com/dehowell/codex-vitae) is an attempt to make my personal philosophical scaffolding explicit.
