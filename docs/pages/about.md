David Howell is a software developer, but isn't comfortable being pigeon-holed as just a STEM-type. He did some graduate work in physics and worked on a variety of particle physics experiments, but ultimately found writing software a more congenial career path for a curious generalistâ€”software is all about formalizing other problem domains. Besides, software engineering has its own panoply of theoretical paradigms, weird rituals, and obtuse systems to learn.
