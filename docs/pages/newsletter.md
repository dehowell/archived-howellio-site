The Marginalia Club is my email newsletter. Once you subscribe, you'll receive a periodic shipment of sketches, notes what I've been reading, and my recommended links.

Typical themes are behavior change, technical leadership, and systems thinking. I read widely (from philosophy, history, management theory, and more), but those are the domains where I tend to explore the things I learn.
