Howdy! Thank you for visiting.

I'm a software architect and normie suburb dad with an ambitious reading list. My background is in experimental nuclear physics and having interests too diverse to tolerate finishing a PhD; instead, I've found software a more congenial home for a curious generalist. My current operating theory is that the future of software development is as much queuing theory and business ethnography as it is computer science.

You may enjoy trying out ["in.c"](http://pixel-to-noise.github.io/in.c/), a participatory web-based performance of [Terry Riley's "In C"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_C)[^1]. If you are a software developer, you might like my [annotated bibliography on the D3 data visualization library](https://www.howell.io/bibliography/d3)[^2] or the [ontology of Java types](https://github.com/dehowell/ontology/blob/master/README.md) I designed (inspired by the fiction of Jorge Luis Borges and various features of the Java Virtual Machine). If you have a philosophical bent, check out my [Codex Vitae](https://github.com/dehowell/codex-vitae "David Howell's Codex Vitae")[^3], where I maintain a record of my personal philosophical scaffolding.

I enjoy mischievous and esoteric experiments in software, music, and literature. I'm also endlessly fascinated by infrastructure (physical and digital), how people collaborate to keep it running, and how much we can learn when things go wrong. All of my interests wind their way back to philosophy; not because I believe philosophy provides the ultimate foundation of knowledge (I don't), but because the best philosophers have pushed the art of exploratory conceptual modeling further than anyone else. My favorites are Manuel De Landa, Martha Nussbaum, and Derek Parfit.
