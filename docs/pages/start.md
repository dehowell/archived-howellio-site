Thank you for visiting.

I'm a software architect and normie suburb dad with an ambitious reading list. My background is in experimental nuclear physics and having interests too diverse to tolerate finishing a PhD; instead, I've found software a more congenial home for a curious generalist. My current operating theory is that the future of software development is as much queuing theory and business ethnography as it is computer science.

## Favorite Projects

### in.c

In collaboration with [Jeffrey Pierce][pierce], I built the installation "in.c" for the [Burlington City Arts' "User Required" exhibition][bca]. Jeffrey and I wanted to open up the hypnotic experience of performing [Terry Riley's composition "In C"][inc] to non-musicians. The original piece consists of sequence of musical phrases, repeated at the discretion of the performer. In our installation, software instruments perform the segments of "In C", but leave modulation of their voices and the overall structure up to the human performer.

### Codex Vitae

Following the sterling examples of [Buster Benson](https://busterbenson.com/), I maintain my own [Codex Vitae](https://github.com/dehowell/codex-vitae "David Howell's Codex Vitae") as an ongoing record of my philosophical scaffolding. While I love a good conceptual abstraction for its own sake, I'm most interested in philosophy as something to be _lived_.

I read my Codex Vitae as part of my weekly review, as a way of re-centering on my values and lessons I've learned.

### Personalized Oblique Strategies

Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt created [the Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies) for getting unstuck in art; I've my own derived my own for getting unstuck in life.

### D3 Annotated Bibliography

[D3 (Data-Driven Documents)](https://d3js.org) is a JavaScript data visualization library created by Mike Bostock. Unlike charting library that provide pre-baked chart types, D3 is a toolkit for building up your own novel visualizations from geometric primitives.

I documented my own journey through [the D3 learning curve with an annotated bibliography](https://www.howell.io/bibliography/d3). I hope you find it useful!

### Analog Index

### An Ontology of Demented Java Types

Oblique jokes and cross-domain encoding are my favorite ways to learn. If you're a software developer, you may enjoy [my set of interfaces inspired by the fiction of Jorge Luis Borges and various features of the Java Virtual Machine](https://github.com/dehowell/ontology/blob/master/README.md).

```java
/**
 * Attempts to use the Java Reflection API on objects that implement
 * Obtuse will always provide unhelpful, but technically correct,
 * type signatures.
 */
public interface Obtuse {
}
```

I enjoy mischievous and esoteric experiments in software, music, and literature. I'm also endlessly fascinated by infrastructure (physical and digital), how people collaborate to keep it running, and how much we can learn when things go wrong. All of my interests wind their way back to philosophy; not because I believe philosophy provides the ultimate foundation of knowledge (I don't), but because the best philosophers have pushed the art of exploratory conceptual modeling further than anyone else. My favorites are Manuel De Landa, Martha Nussbaum, and Derek Parfit.
