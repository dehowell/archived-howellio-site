Howdy! Thanks for visiting.

I'm a software architect {{need more}}. I thought I was going to be physicist, but software has been a more congenial path for a curious generalist.

My current operating theory is that the future of software development is a mix of logic puzzles, queuing theory, and business ethnography.

Most of my projects have been proprietary, but you may enjoy ["in.c"][inc], a web-based performance of [Terry Riley's "In C"][riley], co-created with [Jeffrey Pierce][pierce] for the [Burlington City Arts' "User Required" exhibition][bca]. I wrote [an annotated bibliography about D3][d3], the JavaScript data visualization engine. While learning my way around the Java Virtual Machine, I designed an [ontology of Java types][borges] inspired by the fiction of Jorge Luis Borges.

I enjoy the intersection of esoteric domains; I'm sorry.

THREE THINGS I'M INTERESTED IN

Philosophy (especially Manuel De Landa, Derek Parfit, and Martha Nussbaum)
Mischievous experiments in software
Infrastructure and collaboration
