Chapter 6 of Tyler Cowen's _Stubborn Attachments_ addresses the "epistemic critique" of consequentialism: can we reasonably choose a course of action based on its short-term benefits, given the possibility of horrendous butterfly-effect costs in the long term?

I'm still mulling over his argument, but there's a tangent on political humility I want to share:

> Given the radical uncertainty of the more distant future, we can't know how to achieve preferred goals with any kind of certainty over longer time horizons. Our attachment to particular means should therefore be highly tentative, highly uncertain, and radically contingent.
>
> Our specific policy views, though we may rationally believe them to be the best available, will stand only a slight chance of being correct. They ought to stand the highest chance of being correct of all available views, but this chance will not be very high in absolute terms. Compare the choice of one's politics to betting on the team most favored to win the World Series at the beginning of the season. That team does indeed have the best chance of winning, but most of the time it does not end up being the champion. Most of the time our sports predictions are wrong, even if we are good forecasters on average. So it is with politics and policy.

Tyler Cowen leans libertarian (and I don't), but the fact that he really tries to live by this attitude is what makes his writing so valuable for me[^1]. In this time when the Republican party is swamped by resentment rather than a positive vision for the future, I'm glad to hear voices critical to my own policy attachments. I need the reminder that I can debate politics without being swept up in partisan rancor.

Of course, there are issues where I believe human rights are at stake. I'm not willing to trade them away in cost-benefit analysisâ€”if I were, they would hardly be _rights_. But the trap I want to avoid is believing that the consequences _I_ expect from someone else's policy choices are a fair representation of the ends they desire.
