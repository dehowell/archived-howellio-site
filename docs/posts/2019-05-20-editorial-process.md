Reflecting over the past few years of my writing, I've been most comfortable hammering out posts of five hundred or so words. That's enough space to share an interesting link or suggest a connection between things, but not to develop ideas that feel like my own. Trying to write beyond that limit has been a frustrating struggle. I've been compelled to write ever since I learned to read, but I want

— which means that any perceived failure to _write_ terrifies me. I can hardly imagine a larger threat to my sense of self.

I intend to look directly at this discomfort and fix it — or at least figure how to engineer around it. Otherwise, I will spiral between aspiration and disappointment indefinitely, and that is no way to live a life.

I intend to get on a regular cadence for publishing my newsletter, ["The Marginalia Club"][1] (see footer for a link to subscribe), but I need more than a regular deadline to break out of my five hundred word bottleneck. Without otherwise changing my habits, I'll just panic and write the same old kind of fragmented five hundred words every time the deadline rolls around.

Austin Kleon has a method of nested journalling practices, using his ["notebook turducken"][2]:

> I carry the pocket notebook all day, scribble stuff in it, take notes. It’s basically a scratch pad. Then, every morning after breakfast, I open up the pocket notebook, check my notes, then I fill out my logbook, which is sort of like an index of my days and a memory refresher. Then, I write and draw 3-10 pages in my diary, based on my notes and my log. I cross off things in my pocket notebook after I write about them. The diary then becomes a place I go to when I need new writing and blog posts.

I'm plotting out my own version of this, but building from the raw material of my Instapaper highlights, underlined passages, and marginalia in the books I read. All of those things go into Evernote.

I spend a little time every day browsing Evernote, free associating between notes. I read a note from one article I read, follow my "this makes me think of…" hunches to other notes, etc. If I get a good chain of them going, I copy highlights to a [Scapple board][3], map out the connections, and riff on the theme.

Once I feel an argument form, I try to linearize it into an outline. I intend to bounce back and forth between the collage and outline until the argument seems sound and the structure feels ready. At that point, it's time to write a draft.

I haven't yet made it all the way through this cycle. I tried drafting my next issue yesterday, but got stuck pretty fast. Instead of beating myself up about it, I'm trying to take that as a sign that my outline didn't get to escape velocity yet.

Back to the editing room!
