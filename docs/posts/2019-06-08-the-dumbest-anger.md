I'm going to tell you about the dumbest thing that makes me angry.

I often listen to podcasts while I wash the dishes. If I'm using wired headphones to do so, my phone needs to be in my pocket with the wire dangling loose at exactly the right height to wrap around a door knob, yank the headphones out of my hears, and trigger a sudden and acute rage. "FUCK!", I'll yell, indignant that these GODDAMN cabinets OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER than messing with MY HEADPHONES.

I do not endorse outrage at inanimate objects, but I find this particular foible challenging to short-circuit. In other areas of my life, meditation and cognitive behavioral therapy have helped me reframe my gut reactions in a more generous direction. A physical shock happens too fast and my anger is fully formed before I've even processed what happened.

It helped to get wireless headphones, which has been my main thought while observing the recent spate of anti-AirPods articles.
